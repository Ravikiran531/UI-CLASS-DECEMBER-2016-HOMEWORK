You've been designing your site and have figured out that a page can be as long as necessary. This is great, but it can be a pain when you're dealing with longer pages. Help out your visitors by providing links that quickly take them to specific locations on the page. To do this within Visual Site Designer, you'll need to use the HTML tool to create two HTML boxes on the page. One box will be used for the link, and the other will be used to set the anchor.
The first step is to set an anchor. The anchor is the place on the page where you want the user to be able to jump to. Select the HTML tool and click the place on the page where you would like to set the anchor. Then, enter the following code\
<a name="anchorname"></a><h2>Here is my text</h2>
The next step is to create a link to the anchor you just set. To do this, click the place on the page where you would like the link to appear, and enter the following link code into the Body HTML tab:
<a href="#jsmith">Click here to learn about John Smith.</a>
