images:Images come in all sizes. So do screens. Responsive images automatically adjust to fit the size of the screen.
Create responsive images by adding an .img-responsive class to the <img> tag. The image will then scale nicely to the parent element.
A jumbotron indicates a big box for calling extra attention to some special content or information.

A jumbotron is displayed as a grey box with rounded corners. It also enlarges the font sizes of the text inside it.
