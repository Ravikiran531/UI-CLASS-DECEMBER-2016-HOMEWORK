what is self?
ans)self.setTimeout() will look up the property self on the window object, which is the window object itself. So if you call self.setTimeout() it is the same as window.self.setTimeout() which is the same as window.setTimeout() which again is the same as setTimeout() 
what are closures?
ans)A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variablesâ€”scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function's variables, and it has access to the global variables.
what is hoisting?
ans)Variable and Function Hoisting in JavaScript. ... One of the trickier aspects of JavaScript for new JavaScript developers is the fact that variables and functions are "hoisted." Rather than being available after their declaration, they might actually be available beforehand.
what are different events in java script?
ans)HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.

When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

HTML Events
An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

An HTML web page has finished loading
An HTML input field was changed
An HTML button was clicked
Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

With single quotes:

<some-HTML-element some-event='some JavaScript'>
With double quotes:

<some-HTML-element some-event="some JavaScript">
In the following example, an onclick attribute (with code), is added to a button element:

Example
<button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>

In the example above, the JavaScript code changes the content of the element with id="demo".

In the next example, the code changes the content of its own element (using this.innerHTML):

Example
<button onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>

JavaScript code is often several lines long. It is more common to see event attributes calling functions:

Example
<button onclick="displayDate()">The time is?</button>

Common HTML Events
Here is a list of some common HTML events:

Event	Description
onchange	An HTML element has been changed

onmouseover	The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
onmouseout	The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
